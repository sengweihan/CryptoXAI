## Prerequiste
Before you get started, make sure you have satisfied the following software
requirements:
### Python (v 3.8 or greater) and pip:
● The easiest way to install Python is to use the official Python installer. You
can download the installer from the Python website:
https://www.python.org/downloads/


● Once you have downloaded the installer, run it and follow the on-screen

**pip install tensorflow**

Do note that if you want to install the GPU version of TensorFlow, you still need to
use the same command as above. However, due to the specific requirements of
the GPU version of Tensorflow, follow these steps to install the proper flavour of
Tensorflow

### NumPy:
